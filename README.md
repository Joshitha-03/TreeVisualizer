# Tree Visualizer

An interactive web-based tool to **construct and visualize Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and Max Heaps** from a given input array. This project helps in understanding tree data structures and their properties through dynamic visualization.

---

## 🌟 Features
- Input an array of numbers and visualize the following tree structures:
  - **Binary Tree**  
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
  - **Max Heap**
- Interactive visualization with nodes and links clearly displayed.
- Helps in understanding tree construction and traversal logic.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **JavaScript** – Tree construction algorithms and visualization  
- **HTML & CSS** – User interface and styling  
- **DOM Manipulation** – Dynamically displays the trees based on input
